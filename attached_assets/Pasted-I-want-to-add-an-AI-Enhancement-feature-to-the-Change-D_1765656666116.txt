I want to add an AI Enhancement feature to the Change Description field in the Change Order flow. The goal is to impress the user while staying legally safe and technically clean.

DECISION

We will offer ONE single button only (no multiple options) to avoid confusion.

Button label suggestion:

“Enhance with AI”

This button will intelligently transform the contractor’s short notes into a well-structured, attorney-style change description.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
1️⃣ What the AI does

When the user clicks “Enhance with AI”:

The AI takes:

The contractor’s raw text

Financial impact (+ / – and amount)

Timeline adjustment (new date or delta days)

Basic data from the linked original contract

It rewrites the content in clear, professional legal language

It organizes the text into a structured format suitable for a Change Order

2️⃣ Strict rule: NO invention

The AI must:

❌ NOT invent materials, quantities, dates, or conditions

✅ Only reorganize, clarify, and legally formalize existing inputs

✅ Clearly connect scope change → cost impact → timeline impact

This is critical.

OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT)

The generated text should follow a consistent, premium structure like:

Change Summary

Detailed Scope of Change

Cost Impact

Schedule Impact

Confirmation Statement
(“All other terms and conditions of the original contract remain unchanged.”)

This should feel “lawyer-grade”, not generic AI text.

UX REQUIREMENTS

Clicking “Enhance with AI” opens a preview modal:

Shows enhanced version of the text

Actions:

Apply → replaces the description field

Regenerate → creates a new version

Cancel → keeps original text

Do NOT auto-replace without user confirmation.

DATA & AUDIT (LIGHTWEIGHT BUT IMPORTANT)

Store:

aiEnhanced: true | false

aiOriginalText

aiFinalText

aiModelVersion

timestamp

This is for transparency and future-proofing.

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

This feature must NOT touch:

PDF generator

Signature system

URLs or validation flow

It only affects the HTML content passed to the existing PDF engine.

SCOPE

Implement this only for Change Order as a pilot.

If successful, we can later reuse the pattern for Addendum, Warranty, etc.

Proceed with this enhancement carefully. The goal is:
contractor writes 2 lines → system produces a document that looks professionally drafted.
