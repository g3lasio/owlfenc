I’m attaching the signed Change Order PDF. Overall the flow works, but I noticed a few important issues that we should address to make the dual signature system fully solid and consistent.

1️⃣ Company profile data not fully captured

It looks like the system is not capturing all Company Profile fields in the signed document.

The company email is missing.

Please verify that all required company profile data is consistently injected into the PDF and signature metadata.

2️⃣ Duplicate signature fields issue

There appears to be a duplication of signature fields:

The original PDF template already includes designated signature areas.

The dual signature system does not seem to detect these existing fields.

As a result, the system injects additional signature fields, causing duplication in the final signed document.

We need one of the following (preferred approach is detection):

Detect and reuse existing signature placeholders in the PDF, or

Ensure the system does not inject new signature fields when placeholders already exist.

3️⃣ Digital Certificate of Authenticity inconsistency

The Digital Certificate of Authenticity generated for this document is different from other contracts.

It’s acceptable for templates to vary slightly, but the certificate format should remain consistent across all documents.

We need a unified structure to avoid confusion and maintain professional/legal consistency.

4️⃣ Client signature link performance issue

The client signature link takes too long to load before the client can review and sign the document.

This can negatively impact the signing experience.

Please review latency, preloading, or blocking operations before the document is rendered to the client.

Goal

The objective is:

Clean, non-duplicated signatures

Complete and consistent company data

A unified authenticity certificate across all contracts

Fast, reliable access for client signing

Please review these items and let me know your proposed fixes before implementing.
