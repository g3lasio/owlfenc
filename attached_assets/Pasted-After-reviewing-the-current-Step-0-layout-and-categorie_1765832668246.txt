After reviewing the current Step 0 layout and categories, the structure is correct, but we are still missing several key documents that contractors expect to see. Even if not implemented yet, these should be visible as Coming Soon to complete the legal picture and reinforce confidence in the platform.

Below is what I recommend adding by category, with justification.

1️⃣ CONTRACTS – Missing (Coming Soon)

These are core contract types used daily by contractors. Not having them listed makes the system feel incomplete.

Add as Coming Soon:

Lump Sum / Fixed Price Contract
Most common contract type in residential and commercial projects.

Time & Materials (T&M) Contract
Essential for repairs, emergency work, and undefined scopes.

Cost-Plus Contract
Used in large remodels and projects with evolving scope.

Unit Price Contract
Critical for fencing, paving, and repetitive work priced per unit.

Why these matter:
Contractors think in these terms. Seeing them listed immediately signals that the system understands real-world contracting.

2️⃣ AMENDMENTS – Minor but Important Addition

Current list is good (Change Order, Addendum, Work Order), but one more document would strengthen legal coverage.

Add as Coming Soon:

Scope Clarification Notice
Used to document clarifications without changing price or timeline.
Extremely useful in dispute prevention.

3️⃣ SUBCONTRACTS – Must Be Expanded (Coming Soon)

Right now, Subcontracts feel underrepresented.

Add as Coming Soon:

General Subcontractor Agreement

Roofing Subcontract

Electrical Subcontract

Plumbing Subcontract

HVAC Subcontract

Concrete Subcontract

Framing Subcontract

Drywall Subcontract

Painting Subcontract

Landscaping Subcontract

Why this matters:
Contractors manage work by trade. Listing these creates immediate trust and shows the platform is built for real construction workflows.

Guiding Principle

Not everything needs to be active immediately, but everything that is essential should be visible.

Coming Soon items:

Educate users

Communicate roadmap

Prevent future UX rework

Increase perceived platform value

Constraints

No logic changes required

Registry + UI only

Mark all as coming_soon

No impact on existing flows

Goal

Step 0 should feel like a complete legal control panel, not a partial generator.

Please add these documents as Coming Soon under their respective categories and confirm once updated.
