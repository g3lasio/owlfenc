I reviewed the latest Change Order PDF and we are in a very good place. The system works, the document is legally coherent, and it is already usable. Now we need to elevate it to the next level.

The goal is simple:
This document should look and read as if it were drafted by a top-tier litigation attorney. Harvey Specter doesn’t walk into court unless he knows he’s going to win. That’s the standard.

REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS (CONTENT + PRESENTATION)
1️⃣ Footer branding (mandatory)

Add a consistent footer on every page:

“Powered by Mervin AI”

Subtle

Professional

Same placement on all pages

Not distracting, but clearly present

This was part of the original vision and should now be enforced as a standard across all templates.

2️⃣ Elevate the legal tone (Harvey Specter standard)

The current content is correct, but we want it to feel:

More authoritative

More deliberate

More litigation-ready

This means:

Stronger legal phrasing

Cleaner sentence structure

No casual or generic language

Every paragraph should feel intentional

The document should read like:

“This was drafted by someone who fully expected this to be challenged in court.”

3️⃣ Description of Change: tighten and professionalize

Even when AI enhancement is used, the output must always:

Clearly attribute the change to the Client’s request

Explicitly connect scope → cost → (if applicable) timeline

Avoid ambiguity or open interpretation

This section is the most likely to be scrutinized in a dispute. It must be airtight.

4️⃣ Timeline language consistency

If the Change Order states no timeline impact, then:

The general clause about potential timeline adjustments must not contradict that.

Either:

Clearly state “No adjustment to the project completion date”, or

Explicitly define under what limited conditions an adjustment may occur

No vague language that can be twisted later.

5️⃣ Date formatting (court-facing detail)

Replace all technical timestamps like:
2025-11-26T23:36:42.540Z

With clean legal formatting:

“November 26, 2025”

This is small, but in court these details matter.

6️⃣ Visual polish (subtle, not flashy)

Without turning this into a marketing piece:

Improve spacing and hierarchy in the text

Section titles should feel deliberate

The document should visually signal seriousness and confidence

Think:

Clean

Balanced

Professional

Litigation-ready

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

Do NOT change the PDF engine

Do NOT change the signature system

Do NOT break existing templates

This is a template and styling refinement, not a refactor

END GOAL

When this Change Order is:

Downloaded

Printed

Placed on a judge’s desk

It should immediately communicate:

“This contractor knew exactly what they were doing.”

That’s the bar.

Proceed with these refinements and confirm once the updated PDF reflects this level.
