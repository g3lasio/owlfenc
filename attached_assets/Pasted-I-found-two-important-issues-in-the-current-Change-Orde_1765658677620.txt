I found two important issues in the current Change Order flow that we need to fix to keep the system logically correct and user-proof.

ISSUE 1: AI Enhancement depends on Financial & Timeline inputs, but the UI order is backwards
What’s happening

The AI Enhancement correctly uses:

Financial Impact (+ / – amount)

Timeline Adjustment

The contractor’s short “Description of Changes”

However, in the current Step 2 layout:

The Change Description appears before Financial Impact

Contractors often click Enhance with AI before defining costs or timeline

Result:
The AI assumes $0 cost impact and no schedule impact, which is incorrect and misleading

This is not an AI bug, it’s a flow order problem.

Why this matters

The AI output becomes legally weaker and factually wrong if:

Cost and timeline are not defined first

Enhancement is triggered too early

REQUIRED FIX (UX + Logic)

For Change Order Step 2, the input order must be:

1️⃣ Financial Impact (required first)
2️⃣ Timeline Adjustment (optional, but before AI)
3️⃣ Description of Changes (text input)
4️⃣ Enhance with AI button

The AI button should:

Be visually associated with the Description field

But logically depend on Financial + Timeline data already being filled

Optionally be disabled until a financial impact is entered

👉 Goal:
The contractor defines facts first, then the AI enhances them.

ISSUE 2: Original Contract summary shows Client Name as N/A
What’s happening

In Step 2, the Original Contract summary panel:

Shows contract details correctly

But Client Name appears as “N/A”

However:

In Step 1, the correct client name is visible when selecting the contract

So the data exists, but it’s not being mapped correctly into Step 2

REQUIRED FIX (Data Mapping)

Ensure the selected contract’s client data is:

Passed from Step 1 → Step 2

Correctly mapped to the summary UI

Client Name should NEVER be N/A if it exists on the contract

Likely causes:

Field mismatch (e.g. client.name vs customerName)

Partial object passed instead of full contract record

EXPECTATION

Please fix both issues with minimal changes:

Do NOT touch the PDF generator

Do NOT change signature logic

Do NOT refactor the overall flow

Once fixed:

AI enhancement will produce accurate legal language

Contract summary will be trustworthy and consistent

Let me know once both are corrected so I can retest the Change Order end-to-end.
