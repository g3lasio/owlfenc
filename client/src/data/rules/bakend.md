4. Editable Estimate Generation
The backend assembles the estimate using the selected template and calculated data.
The estimate is structured as a JSON object, including:
Contractor and client info.
Project details.
Itemized list of materials (name, quantity, unit price, total).
Labor costs.
Permits and additional fees.
Subtotals, taxes, and grand total.
Terms and conditions.
This JSON is sent to the frontend, where it is rendered as a professional, editable table or form.
The user (contractor) can manually adjust any field (quantities, prices, labor rates, etc.) before finalizing.
5. Finalization and Output
Once the estimate is reviewed and approved by the user:
The backend generates a PDF using the finalized data and template.
The PDF is stored and a download link is provided.
The estimate can be sent via email/SMS to the client, with tracking for delivery and approval.
The backend logs all actions and changes for compliance and future reference.
6. Integration with Chat and Manual Modes
Chat Mode:
The backend exposes endpoints that allow the conversational agent (chatbot) to:
Collect data step-by-step.
Trigger calculations and template selection.
Present editable previews and accept user adjustments.
Finalize and send the estimate.
Manual Mode:
The backend supports batch data submission (via forms), immediate calculation, and direct editing in the frontend before finalization.
7. Security and Validation
All endpoints require authentication and authorization.
Data validation is enforced at every step.
Sensitive data (client info, pricing) is encrypted in transit and at rest.
8. Extensibility
The backend is designed to support new project types, templates, and calculation rules with minimal code changes.
All business logic is modular and well-documented for easy maintenance and scaling.
In summary:
The backend orchestrates the entire estimate generation process, from robust data collection and validation, through dynamic template and calculation logic, to delivering a professional, editable estimate ready for client approvalâ€”seamlessly supporting both chat-driven and manual workflows.
